## Notes from the creator

There are many things I could improve UX wise, like remove the pagination arrows when the click is not allowed or replace the spinner when loading by a placeholder

But I think this is the right time to stop adding more things. Since there are no deadline for this, I could go on for 100 more hours and still find things to improve. But then the position would be filled :)

I am free to answer any questions about this test at jimmyha.dev@gmail.com.
